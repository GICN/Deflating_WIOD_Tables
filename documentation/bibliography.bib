abstract = {Normally, when updating or regionalizing input-output matrices with negative entries, the negative numbers are first brought outside the matrix, then the matrix is updated or regionalized, then the negative numbers are added back to the result. This is theoretically, and sometimes also empirically, a rather unsatisfactory procedure. This paper proposes a theoretically sound alternative for the presently used ad hoc procedure. Based on the first-order conditions of a restated information loss problem, we generalize the RAS-procedure using reciprocals of the exponential transformations of the related Lagrange multipliers. The diagonal matrices that update or regionalize a given matrix optimally are the solutions of a fixed-point problem. To derive a numerical solution, the paper presents the GRAS-algorithm, which is illustrated in terms of a simple updating example.},

abstract = {Junius and Oosterhaven (2003) present a RAS matrix balancing variant that can incorporate negative elements in the balancing. There are, however, a couple of issues in the approach described - the first being the handling of zeros in the initial estimate, and the second being the formulation of their minimum-information principle. We present a corrected exposition of GRAS.},

abstract = {The GRAS method as presented by Junius and Oosterhaven [Junius, T. and J. Oosterhaven (2003) The Solution of Updating or Regionalizing a Matrix with Both Positive and Negative Elements. Economic Systems Research, 15, 87–96] assumes that every row and every column of a matrix to be balanced has at least one positive element. This might not necessarily be true in practice, in particular, when dealing with large-scale input–ouput tables, supply and use tables, social accounting matrices, or, for that matter, any other matrix. In this short note we relax this assumption and make available our MATLAB program for anyone interested in matrix GRASing. The same issue arises in the presentations of the KRAS method [Lenzen, M., B. Gallego and R. Wood (2009) Matrix Balancing Under Conflicting Information. Economic Systems Research, 21, 23–44] and the SUT–RAS method [Temurshoev, U. and M.P. Timmer (2011) Joint Estimation of Supply and Use Tables. Papers in Regional Science, 90, 863–882], which should be accordingly accounted for in their empirical applications.},

@article{Los2014,
abstract = {The first release of WIOD (April 2012) contained world input-output tables (WIOTs) expressed in previous year's prices (pyp). These WIOTs in pyp had been constructed using the well-known double-deflation method, in which value added figures by industry are obtained as residuals (more details are discussed below). Users notified us that this procedure had led to value added figures that were qualitatively different from value added in pyp levels as published by Eurostat, NSIs of non-EU countries and WIOD's own socio-economic satellite accounts. Admittedly, this was an unsatisfactory state of affairs, and hence the tables in pyp were temporarily removed when the November 2013 revisions and updates of the WIOTs in current prices were published. In the meantime, alternatives to the double deflation method were explored. This note briefly describes the alternative deflation method along the lines of which the WIOTs in pyp as published in December 2014 have been constructed, and briefly compares it to the double deflation method.},
